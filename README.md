# Dictionary Tools  

Documentation -> https://isaacksdata.github.io/dictionary-tools/

## Dictionary Structure  

This repo includes tools for understanding the structure of a dictionary data structure.   
For example, you might want to know what types the keys and values are, or how many elements an iterable has.   


## CommentedDict  

This repo also has the CommentedDict data type. This is a sub class of collections.UserDict which allows 
a comment to be added to describe the dictionary.   
The commentedDict is can also handle CommentedKeys and CommentedValues which allow comments to be added for 
individual key:value pairs.
