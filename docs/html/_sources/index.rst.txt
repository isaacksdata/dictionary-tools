============================================



**Dictionary Tools** is a Python library with some convenient tools for data stored in dictionaries.
It allows users to *dissect* the structure of complex nested dictionaries and allows for
documentation within dictionaries e.g. comments for keys and values.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.
